# HPE OneView Redfish Toolkit

This toolkit provides a REST service to answer DMTF's Redfish compliant requests by querying HPE OneView.

HPE OneView is a fresh approach to converged infrastructure management, inspired by the way you expect to work, with a single integrated view of your IT infrastructure.

DMTF's Redfish is an open industry standard specification and schema that specifies a RESTful interface and utilizes JSON and OData to help customers integrate solutions within their existing tool chains.

HPE OneView 4.0 version or above is required.

> In order to integrate properly with OneView, the OneView API 600 is required to be supported by OneView instance.

## Installation

### Requirements

HPE OneView Redfish Toolkit service relies on Python 3.5 or newer (as long as python3 executable is available) to run and [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for dependencies management. A full list of dependencies is available at [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. For pyOpenSSL module please make sure to have OpenSSL lib installed in your system.

> There should be not problem in using Python 3.4 if your system does not have Python 3.5 available, but we do not guarantee complete compatibility as the test environment is set up on version 3.5.

In order to run tests and documentation generation `tox` is also needed. General instructions on how to install are available [here](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

### Production Environment

Install the application:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-redfish-toolkit.git
```

Run the application:

```bash
$ oneview-redfish-toolkit
```

 At first time, it will create all the needed configuration files under user directory, and will prompt for the OneView IP.

You can update the configuration files created under the user directory, or if you want to use custom configuration files you can pass them as arguments:

```bash
$ oneview-redfish-toolkit --config redfish.conf --log-config logging.conf
```

### Development Environment

We recommend to run inside a virtual environment. You can create one running:

```bash
$ virtualenv env_name_you_choose -p python3.5 # to create a Python3.5 environment, for example
$ source env_name_you_choose/bin/activate # load the environment
```

Once the environment is loaded, download and uncompress the latest version from [releases page](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-redfish-toolkit/releases), or clone current development version running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-redfish-toolkit.git
```

Then, proceed with:

```bash
$ cd oneview-redfish-toolkit # enter the service folder
# edit redfish.conf
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # to install all requirements into the virtual environment
$ ./run.sh    # to launch the service
```

## SDK Documentation

The latest version of the SDK documentation can be found in the [SDK Documentation section](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/oneview-redfish-toolkit/index.html).

> Note: This documentation has been manually updated following the steps found [here](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-hpOneView/blob/master/deploy.sh).

## Logging

Logging configuration can be found in `logging.conf` file. The provided configuration enables INFO level at both console and file output (which will generate a `redfish.log` file).

## Configuration

In order to start up oneview-redfish-toolkit service, there is some mandatory configuration at `redfish.conf` file to provide as explained below:

* `redfish` section

  * **xml_prettify**: whether XML objects on answers are indented or not

  * **redfish_host**: the IP address where redfish service will listen to. Using `host = 0.0.0.0` means it will listen to all IP addresses.

  * **redfish_port**: the TCP port where redfish service will listen to

  * **authentication_mode**: can be `conf` or `session`.
    * **`conf`**: credentials from the conf file will be used for the requests. The toolkit will handle authentication with OneView internally.
    * **`session`**: the Redfish client must create a session and use the generated `x-auth-token` for the requests. For more details please check Session Management section.

* `oneview` section

  * **ip**: HPE OneView's IP or FQDN address

* `credentials` section
  Note: HPE OneView credentials are stored in clear-text. Make sure only authorized users can access this file.

  * **username**: HPE OneView's username
  
  * **password**: HPE OneView's password

* `event_service` section

  * **DeliveryRetryAttempts**: The value of this property shall be the number of retrys attempted for any given event to the subscription destination before the subscription is terminated.
  
  * **DeliveryRetryIntervalSeconds**: The value of this property shall be the interval in seconds between the retry attempts for any given event to the subscription destination.

* `ssl` section

  * **SSLType**: How to configure SSL. One of: disabled (no SSL), adhoc (SSL is enabled with self-signed keys generated by the server every time you start the server), self-signed (SSL is enabled with a self-signed cert generated in the certs directory if no files named self-signed.crt and self-signed.key exists in that directory. This will create the certificates on the first run and every time you delete the files and restart the server. The directory **certs must** exist in the system root directory) certs (SSL is enabled with keys provided by user in the fields below). The default value used is adhoc.
  
  * **SSLCertFile**: The user SSL cert file.

  * **SSLKeyFile**: The user SSL key file. Should not have a password.

* `ssl-cert-defaults` section: Defines the values used in the self-signed generated certificate

  * **countryName**: The name of the country. **Required!**
  
  * **stateOrProvinceName**: The name of the state or province. **Required!**

  * **localityName**: Name of the locality (city for example). **Required!**

  * **organizationName**: Name of the organization (company name for example). **Required!**
  
  * **organizationalUnitName**: Name of the organizational unit (department for example). **Required!**

  * **commonName**: FQDN of the server or it's IP address. If not provided will detect de default route IP and use it. **Optional.**
 
  * **emailAddress**: Email address to contact the responsible for this server/certificate. This is an optional information. Will not be added to certificate if not informed. **Optional.**

## Session Management

As specified in the Redfish spec, the endpoints `/redfish` and `/redfish/v1` can be accessed unauthenticated, also POST to Sessions Collection (that's how a Redfish session can be established).

To create a Redfish session, the redfish client must authenticate himself using his own username and password sending a post request to `/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions`. Since current toolkit implementation delegates the session management to OneView, the Redfish client must pass a valid OneView user and password:

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  https://<ip>:5000/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions \
  -d '{"UserName": "administrator", "Password": "password"}'
```
One of the headers in the response is `X-Auth-Token` (generated by OneView during authentication) that should be send for all subsequent requests:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: NzQ8ODI6MTcxOTkxRdvdtE-HaNeFgkoylkaQVA3l1uIsHxQ7" \
  https://<ip>:5000/redfish/v1/Systems
```

**Note**: In the current implementation, each user can have only 1 active session (always mapped to “/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/1” ), GET and DELETE features not implemented. Thus, if the Redfish client creates another session (another POST), the toolkit will just create another session in OneView. The client decides which session token to use. If it is still valid, the request will be processed, otherwise an error will be returned to the client.

## Event Service notes

Currently, Event Service works only when authentication_mode is set to conf and using OneView API version 300. As it connects directly to HPE OneView SCMB, the toolkit will request OneView to generate SCMB certs and/or download the certs to the correct location. The certs file are: **oneview\_ca**: OneView's CA cert file located at: `certs/oneview_ca.pem`. **scmb\_cert**: OneView's SCMB Client cert file located at: `certs/oneview_scmb.pem`. **scmb\_key**: OneView's SCMB Client key file located at: `certs/oneview_scmb.key`
