# HPE OneView Redfish Toolkit

This toolkit provides a REST service to answer DMTF's Redfish compliant requests by querying HPE OneView.

HPE OneView is a fresh approach to converged infrastructure management, inspired by the way you expect to work, with a single integrated view of your IT infrastructure.

DMTF's Redfish is an open industry standard specification and schema that specifies a RESTful interface and utilizes JSON and OData to help customers integrate solutions within their existing tool chains.

HPE OneView 4.0 version or above is required.

> In order to integrate properly with OneView, the OneView API 600 is required to be supported by OneView instance.

## Installation

### Requirements

HPE OneView Redfish Toolkit service relies on Python 3.5 or newer (as long as python3 executable is available) to run and [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for dependencies management. A full list of dependencies is available at [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. For pyOpenSSL module please make sure to have OpenSSL lib installed in your system.

> There should be not problem in using Python 3.4 if your system does not have Python 3.5 available, but we do not guarantee complete compatibility as the test environment is set up on version 3.5.

In order to run tests and documentation generation `tox` is also needed. General instructions on how to install are available [here](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

### Production Environment

Install the application:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-redfish-toolkit.git
```

Run the application:

```bash
$ oneview-redfish-toolkit
```

 At first time, it will create all the needed configuration files under user directory, and will prompt for the OneView IP(s).

You can update the configuration files created under the user directory, or if you want to use custom configuration files you can pass them as arguments:

```bash
$ oneview-redfish-toolkit --config redfish.conf --log-config logging.conf
```

### Development Environment

We recommend to run inside a virtual environment. You can create one running:

```bash
$ virtualenv env_name_you_choose -p python3.5 # to create a Python3.5 environment, for example
$ source env_name_you_choose/bin/activate # load the environment
```

Once the environment is loaded, download and uncompress the latest version from [releases page](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-redfish-toolkit/releases), or clone current development version running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-redfish-toolkit.git
```

Then, proceed with:

```bash
$ cd oneview-redfish-toolkit # enter the service folder
# edit redfish.conf
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # to install all requirements into the virtual environment
$ ./run.sh    # to launch the service
```

## SDK Documentation

The latest version of the SDK documentation can be found in the [SDK Documentation section](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/oneview-redfish-toolkit/index.html).

> Note: This documentation has been manually updated following the steps found [here](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-hpOneView/blob/master/deploy.sh).

## Logging

Logging configuration can be found in `logging.conf` file. The provided configuration enables INFO level at both console and file output (which will generate a `redfish.log` file).

## Configuration

In order to start up oneview-redfish-toolkit service, there is some mandatory configuration at `redfish.conf` file to provide as explained below:

* `redfish` section

  * **xml_prettify**: whether XML objects on answers are indented or not

  * **redfish_host**: the IP address where redfish service will listen to. Using `host = 0.0.0.0` means it will listen to all IP addresses.

  * **redfish_port**: the TCP port where redfish service will listen to

  * **authentication_mode**: can be `conf` or `session`.
    * **`conf`**: credentials from the conf file will be used for the requests. The toolkit will handle authentication with OneView internally.
    * **`session`**: the Redfish client must create a session and use the generated `x-auth-token` for the requests. For more details please check Session Management section.

* `oneview` section

  * **ip**: HPE OneView's IP/FQDN address or comma separated list of OneView's IP/FQDN address for multiple instances.
  Oneview Redfish Toolkit now also includes support for multiple OneView instances, allowing a single instance of the service manage more than one OneView instance instead of instantiating a new service for each HPE OneView that is part of the solution. It simplifies for the Redfish client that does not need to handle multiple connections to the Redfish services.

* `credentials` section
  Note: These credentials are used only for authentication_mode set to "conf". They are stored in clear-text. Make sure only authorized users can access this file. When handling multiple OneView instances, make sure all instances have this username/password enabled.

  * **username**: HPE OneView's username
  
  * **password**: HPE OneView's password

  * **authLoginDomain**: HPE OneView's authentication login domain. If not set, defaults to "Local".

* `event_service` section

  * **DeliveryRetryAttempts**: The value of this property shall be the number of retrys attempted for any given event to the subscription destination before the subscription is terminated.
  
  * **DeliveryRetryIntervalSeconds**: The value of this property shall be the interval in seconds between the retry attempts for any given event to the subscription destination.

* `ssl` section

  * **SSLType**: select one of the options below. The default value used is **adhoc**.
    * **disabled**: no SSL. Flask will be used as the web server.
    * **adhoc**: SSL is enabled with self-signed keys generated by the server every time you start the server. Flask will be used as the web server.
    * **self-signed**: SSL is enabled with a self-signed cert generated in the certs directory if no files named self-signed.crt and self-signed.key exists in that directory. This will create the certificates on the first run and every time you delete the files and restart the server. The directory **certs must** exist in the system root directory) certs (SSL is enabled with keys provided by user in the fields below). Cherrypy will be used as the web server unless the toolkit is initialized in development and debug mode (arguments set "--dev" and "--debug"). In this case, Flask will be used as the web server.
  
  * **SSLCertFile**: The user SSL cert file.

  * **SSLKeyFile**: The user SSL key file. Should not have a password.

* `ssl-cert-defaults` section: Defines the values used in the self-signed generated certificate

  * **countryName**: The name of the country. **Required!**
  
  * **stateOrProvinceName**: The name of the state or province. **Required!**

  * **localityName**: Name of the locality (city for example). **Required!**

  * **organizationName**: Name of the organization (company name for example). **Required!**
  
  * **organizationalUnitName**: Name of the organizational unit (department for example). **Required!**

  * **commonName**: FQDN of the server or it's IP address. If not provided will detect de default route IP and use it. **Optional.**
 
  * **emailAddress**: Email address to contact the responsible for this server/certificate. This is an optional information. Will not be added to certificate if not informed. **Optional.**

## Session Management

As specified in the Redfish spec, the endpoints `/redfish` and `/redfish/v1` can be accessed unauthenticated, also POST to Sessions Collection (that's how a Redfish session can be established).

To create a Redfish session, the redfish client must authenticate himself using his own username and password sending a post request to `/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions`. Since current toolkit implementation delegates the session management to OneView, the Redfish client must pass a valid OneView user and password:

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  https://<ip>:5000/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions \
  -d '{"UserName": "administrator", "Password": "password"}'
```
One of the headers in the response is `X-Auth-Token` (generated by OneView during authentication) that should be send for all subsequent requests:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: NzQ8ODI6MTcxOTkxRdvdtE-HaNeFgkoylkaQVA3l1uIsHxQ7" \
  https://<ip>:5000/redfish/v1/Systems
```
When handling multiple OneView instances, make sure all instances have this username/password enabled.

**Note**: In the current implementation, each user can have only 1 active session (always mapped to “/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/1” ), GET and DELETE features not implemented. Thus, if the Redfish client creates another session (another POST), the toolkit will just create another session in OneView. The client decides which session token to use. If it is still valid, the request will be processed, otherwise an error will be returned to the client.

## Event Service notes

Current implementation follows Redfish specification [DSP0266 version 1.5.0](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0266_1.5.0.pdf). Event Service works only when authentication_mode is set to conf and using OneView API version 300. As it connects directly to HPE OneView SCMB, the toolkit will request OneView to generate SCMB certs and/or download the certs to the correct location. The certs file are: **oneview\_ca**: OneView's CA cert file located at: `certs/oneview_ca.pem`. **scmb\_cert**: OneView's SCMB Client cert file located at: `certs/oneview_scmb.pem`. **scmb\_key**: OneView's SCMB Client key file located at: `certs/oneview_scmb.key`

Only alerts and events related to enclosures, racks and server hardware are being monitored and will generate the following Redfish events: ResourceAdded, ResourceUpdated and ResourceRemoved.

## Composition Service

Current implementation follows Redfish specification [DSP2050 version 1.0.0](https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2050_1.0.0.pdf), and does not use any Oem (vendor specific) attribute. One of the biggest challenges about adding composability support was to identify what type of Resource Blocks should be available since full composability is not available due to limitations in the current specification. A first approach leveraging OneView Server Profile Templates was proposed and evaluted with Redfish authors. On this proposal each OneView server profile template maps to Resource Zones that may list three types of resource blocks:
*	**Storage Resource Block**: each SAS drive from existing Drive Enclosures is mapped for a specifc Resource Zone if the SAS storage controller in the Server Profile Template is configured, thus presenting information about CapacityBytes, Protocol and MediaType. Other type of storage as local disks and SAN are out of scope.
*	**Network Resource Block**: all connections (ethernet network and network sets) specified in the Server Profile Template are mapped to Ethernet Interfaces that are part of a Network Resource Block, thus presenting information about network name, speedMbps and VLAN/VLANs.
*	**Computer System Resource Block**: each server hardware that matches the server hardware type selected in the server profile template (Resource Zone) is mapped as a Computer System Resource Block, thus presenting information about Processor (Model, MaxSpeedMHz, TotalCores) and Memory. OneView Redfish service is responsible for making sure to list only Computer System Resource Blocks and Storage Resource Blocks that can be composed for a specific Resource Zone, thus extra validations had to be implemented instead of leveraging OneView server profile API directly.

On the composition request, the Redfish client must select one Computer System Resource Block, one Network Resource Block and as many Storage Resource Blocks from the available Resource Blocks on the selected Resource Zone. The required attributes to be send in the composition request are specified in the Capabilities Object. A server profile will be created leveraging the configuration from the server profile template as identified in the POST request. Each Storage Resource Block (SAS drive) will be configured as external logical JBOD (logical drives are out of scope).

**Important**: To have the Composition Service functional, the administrator must create OneView Server Profile Templates in advance. Each template should be ready to create a server profile in OneView. In case there are available Drive Enclosures that should be composed via Redfish service, the SAS storage controller should be configured but no drives should be added in the template. The drives will be assigned to the server profile on the composition request as described above. If there are no server profile templates created, no Resource Zone will be available.
